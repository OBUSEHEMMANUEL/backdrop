Reasons why pure Levenshtein Distance algorithm might be a more effective solution than the broader 
Damerauâ€“Levenshtein Distance algorithm in this specific scenario is Damerau-Levenshtein considers an additional operation, 
which can increase the computational cost and potentially lead to a less accurate result.
in this case the additional computational cost of Damerau Levenshtein is not necessary.
